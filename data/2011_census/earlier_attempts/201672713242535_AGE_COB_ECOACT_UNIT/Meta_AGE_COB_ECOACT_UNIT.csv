F280963,DC6210SC0004,Economic activity,Total\ Economic activity,"Economic activity relates to whether or not a person who was aged 16 to 74 was working or looking for work in the week before census. Rather than a simple indicator of whether or not someone was currently in employment, it provides a measure of whether or not a person was an active participant in the labour market.
<br/>
A person's economic activity is derived from their 'activity last week'. This is an indicator of their status or availability for employment - whether employed, unemployed, or their status if not employed and not seeking employment. Additional information included in the economic activity classification is also derived from information about the number of hours a person works and their type of employment - whether employed or self-employed.

The country of birth question included six tick-box responses: one for each of the four parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland); one for the Republic of Ireland; and one for 'Elsewhere'. 
<br/>
Where a person ticked 'Elsewhere', they were asked to write in the current name of the country in which they were born. Responses are assigned codes based on the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/national-statistics-country-classification/index.html" target="_blank">National Statistics Country Classification</a>.
<br/>
The grouping of countries within the classification is broadly regional, but takes into account the grouping of European Union (EU) countries. Countries in the EU are grouped into those that were EU members in March 2001, and those that became members (accession countries) between April 2001 and March 2011 as part of the EU enlargement process.

F74418,LC6203EW0012,Economic activity,Total\ Economic activity,"Economic activity relates to whether or not a person who was aged 16 to 74 was working or looking for work in the week before census. Rather than a simple indicator of whether or not someone was currently in employment, it provides a measure of whether or not a person was an active participant in the labour market.
<br/>
A person's economic activity is derived from their 'activity last week'. This is an indicator of their status or availability for employment - whether employed, unemployed, or their status if not employed and not seeking employment. Additional information included in the economic activity classification is also derived from information about the number of hours a person works and their type of employment - whether employed or self-employed.
<br/>
The census concept of economic activity is compatible with the standard for economic status defined by the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/classifications/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">International Labour Organisation (ILO)</a>. It is one of a number of definitions used internationally to produce accurate and comparable statistics on employment, unemployment and economic status.",
